=========
2 January 

- attacks with >2 warships in age 2 (still >3 in Age3+)
- attacks enemy warship if there's no dock
- we check if there are any nearby warships and if we have less than 2 or 3, depending on age (to build more)
- Prioritize ships in the following order - Age3: Caravel, Frigate, Monitor, Galleon. Age4: Frigate, Caravel, Monitor, Galleon.
- Hard and above on water spawn maps makes 2 docks Age 1 and 2, 4 Age 3 and above. Below Hard makes 1 and 2, respectfully
- 3 More Frigate or 1-3 Caravel or equivalent amount of war ships than enemy depending on difficulty
- If it's a good time to fish, try to build a forward dock
- Don't fish until age2 transition. Unless it's an island map. Then it's always a good time (after age up)
- Docks are high priority on island maps
- Make new dock location if enemy navy is stronger than ours and too close to dock
- Removes transport penalty as Age advances
- Make new dock location (newNavyVec) if enemy navy is spotted
- Add position influence for towers to build near docks on water maps
 - Weight towers to stay very close to center point, unless it's a navy map, then go far away

==========
3 January

- Naval "exploration" turns into patrols with multiple warships
- Warships prioritized over fishing boats for exploration

research tower upgrade tech a little earlier on island maps
reserve resources for fishing boats on island maps

==========
27 January

If enemy are too close to fishing ships, they retreat to forts, tc's, towers, or docks
Wagon building issue fixed (workaround)

==========
29 January

Reordered warship attack plans to attack/Raid: Forts, Warships, Fishing boats, Docks, Towers
Attack manager altered to allow for simultaneous land and navy attacks

==========
11 February

Created AssertiveWall file to place all new functions in (should help with merging any future updates)
Added check to allow the AI to try making attack plans again after a certain amount of time even if there is an existing attack plan
  This is an attempt to fix the lack of attacks coming from the AI in lategame
Enabled Walls to be build, and sets a large build radius on island maps (seawall)

==========
14 February

Walls changed to build ring around docks

==========
16 February

Galleon shipment regarded as more valuable if there are enemy towers
AI won't wait to age on island maps

==========
15 March

Updates incorporated into aiHCCards
Updates incorporated into aimilitary
Updates incorporated into aiSetup

Official March updates incorporated
Tweaked dock placement while under threat
Adjusted defense reflex to apply to any enemy units on the same island (needs more testing)
Toned down the walls
Adjusted the reset mechanism for failed attack transports (still needs work)
Enabled forward bases to be built without a fort under certain conditions

==========
17 March

Fixed tower positioning so towers more likely to build along coast
Method of military throttling changed, and now takes into account rush vs boom civs
Reduced the number of artillery in the naval defense plan
fix to defense reflex (needs more work)
Potential improvement to attacking

==========
23 March

Adapted Ceylon Nomad start to standard games

==========
24 March

Rave Reviews:
"actually pretty decent" 
"like, it has its quirks"
-KG19991380

"Oh boi"
-AlistairJah

"Sadly, it seems it still has problems"
-EntombedCurve02







To do:
Further develop the naval AI
  fix attack plan transport
  stop caravels from fishing so much

Change the attack/retreat conditions
Develop a new attack model
Change the formations to mimic historical formations
Do something with the military that normally just stages under the TC
Create multiple armies/attack plans
Create a raiding force
Rework the forward base
Add defensive fortifications and walls



Garrison fishing boats
Varied fishing strategies
Return units from ancillary islands
PressTheAttack if winning
  -> Should already be there
Japanese fishing boat attacking



ceylon: 
//started as villagerTransportMonitor within aiCore
//when natural resources start dwindling and/or space starts dwindling
//-> move idle villagrs to mainland
//- use ceylon transport code as baseline
building a new set of functions
need a new building monitor that cas accept different bases
maybe just go through building queue and move stuff to new island? starts line 4207
